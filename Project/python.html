        <h1>Python Tutorial</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python is an object-oriented programming language.
                    </li>
                    <li>Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods</li>
                    <li>A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Input from Keyboard</h3>
                <p>The input() function allows user input.

        <h3>Python List</h3>
        <p>There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
            </li>
            <li>Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
            </li>
            <li>Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
            </li>
            <li>Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members</li>
        </ul>
        <p> A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
        </p>
<img src="" alt="">  
    <p>You access the list items by referring to the index number:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h4>Range of Indexes (1/2)
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li> You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.</li>
        <li>When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h3>List Methods
    </h3>
    <p>Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.

        <h3>Python Strings</h3>
        <h4>String Literals</h4>
        <p>String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. <br>
            <span>'hello' is the same as "hello".</span>
        </p>
        <p>You can display a string literal with the print() function:
        </p>
    
    <h4>Assign String to a Variable
    </h4>
    <p>Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
    </p>

        <h3>Python Conditions and If statements </h3>
        <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equals: a == </li>
            <li>Not Equals: a != b </li>
            <li>Less than: a < b </li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b </li>
            <li>Greater than: a > b </li>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops. <br> An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
        </p>
    <h3>Elif</h3>
    <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
    
    <h3>Else</h3>
    <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Python While Loops
    </h3>
    <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h3>The break Statement
    </h3>
    <p>With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    
    <h3>Python For Loops
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). </li>
        <li>This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</li>
        <li>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Python Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
            </li>
            <li>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
            </li>
            <li>A function can return data as a result.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Creating a Function
        </h3>
        <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
        </p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Information can be passed into functions as arguments</li>
        <li>Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. </li>
        <li> Add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.</li>
        <li> The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h4>Parameters or Arguments?
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.
        </li>
        <li> From a function's perspective:
            <ol>
                <li>A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
                </li>
                <li>An argument is the value that are sent to the function when it is called.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

                <h3>Creating A Class In Python</h3>
                <p>To create a class, use the keyword class:
                </p>            
    <img src="" alt="">       
    <h3>The __init__() Function</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
        </li>
        <li>All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
        </li>
        <li>Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
        </li>
    </ul>
